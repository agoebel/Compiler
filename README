1. INVOCATION
=============

1.1   Build: make

1.2   Clean: make clean

1.3   Run Generator:
1.3.1 with input file:
	./comp input_file_no_extension
1.3.2 from stdin:
	./comp
1.3.3 with input file and parse tree
	./comp input_file_no extension -disptree

1.4   Produced file names:
1.4.1 with input file: produces input_file_no_extension.asm
1.4.2 from stdin: produces result.asm

2. STRUCTURE
============

The code generator was build around the semantic analyzer devised for the previous assignment. In addition to the files associated with the semantic analyzer the following new files have been created:
	* generator.h - declarations of data types used by the generator and the main recursive function used by the algorithm recGen()
	* generator.c - implementations of functions defined in semantic.h
